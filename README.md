This code includes the initial conditions and modifications to the PLUTO 4.1 magnetohydrodynamics code of a High-Velocity Cloud moving through a non-uniform magnetised medium as used in the publication Gr√∏nnow, Tepper-Garcia, Bland-Hawthorn & McClure-Griffiths (2017) "Magnetized High Velocity Clouds in the Galactic Halo: A New Distance Constraint".
In the "variable" directory, the halo magnetic field varies as a function of distance from the Galactic midplane as used in the publication. Depending on the init.c file used this is either read from a table file or as an analytical function using the Sun & Reich (2010) model. By changing the init.c file the dependence on the cylindrical radius can also be included and an isothermal rather than adiabatic hot corona can be used as well. In the "uniform" directory the magnetic field is not a function of distance but it is possible to set it to be a randomly tangled field (this was not used in the paper). See the PLUTO documentation at http://plutocode.ph.unito.it/documentation.html on how to compile and run this code.
If you use parts of this code in published work please cite the paper mentioned above.
