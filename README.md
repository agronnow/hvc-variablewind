This code includes the initial conditions and modifications to the PLUTO 4.1 magnetohydrodynamics code of a High-Velocity Cloud moving through a non-uniform magnetised medium as used in the publication Gr√∏nnow, Tepper-Garcia, Bland-Hawthorn & McClure-Griffiths (2017) "Magnetized High Velocity Clouds in the Galactic Halo: A New Distance Constraint".
In the "variable" directory, the halo magnetic field as a function of distance is read from a table as used in the publication. In the "uniform" directory the magnetic field is not a function of distance but it is possible to set it to be a randomly tangled field (this was not used in the paper). See the PLUTO documentation at http://plutocode.ph.unito.it/documentation.html on how to compile and run this code.
If you use parts of this code in published work please cite the paper mentioned above.
